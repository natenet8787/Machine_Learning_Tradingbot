Base line trading Algo
![BaseLine](/Starter_Code/baseline.png)

It appears the baseline algo does not perform as well as the actual returns through the period. The model outperformed actual returns during 2016. After that it failed to outperform actual returns. The model was however much less volatile than the underlying. 

Logistic Regression
![LR](/Starter_Code/LRplot.png)
It appears the new Logistic Regression model performs the very near the same as the base line algorithm. Both algorithms fail to compete with the actual returns of the strategy. It may be best to change strategies or to keep trying to fit the model so that we can see positive returns out of this strategy.
