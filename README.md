Base line trading Algo
![BaseLine](/Starter_code/baseline.png)

It appears the baseline algo does not perform as well as the actual returns through the period. The model outperformed actual returns during 2016. After that it failed to outperform actual returns. The model was however much less volatile than the underlying.
